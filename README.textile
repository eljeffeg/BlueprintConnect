GraphConnect is an attempt to create a generic connection to the different databases by supplying a string of the database type.  This allows you to program a Blueprint application independent of the customer database type, which can be specified in a configuration file.

h3. Normal Neo4j connection
<pre>Graph graph = new Neo4jGraph("/tmp/my_graph");</pre>

h3. Normal OrientDB connection
<pre>Graph graph = new OrientGraph("local:/tmp/orient");</pre>

h3. Normal Rester connection
<pre>Graph graph = new RexsterGraph("http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph");</pre>

h3. GraphConnect connection
<pre>Graph graph = new GraphConnect.openGraph("Neo4j", "/tmp/my_graph");
Graph graph = new GraphConnect.openGraph("OrientDB", "/tmp/orient");
Graph graph = new GraphConnect.openGraph("Rexster", "http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph");</pre>

Note: in the OrientDB example, GraphConnect defaults to local if no prefix exists.
