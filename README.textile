GraphConnect is an attempt to create a generic connection to the different databases by supplying a string of the database type.  This allows you to program a Blueprint application independent of the customer database type, which can be specified in a configuration file.

Normal Neo4j connection
```java
Graph graph = new Neo4jGraph("/tmp/my_graph");
Vertex a = graph.addVertex(null);
Vertex b = graph.addVertex(null);
a.setProperty("name","marko");
b.setProperty("name","peter");
Edge e = graph.addEdge(null, a, b, "knows");
e.setProperty("since", 2006);
graph.shutdown();
```

GraphConnect connection
```java
Graph graph = new GraphConnect.openGraph("Neo4j", "/tmp/my_graph");
Vertex a = graph.addVertex(null);
Vertex b = graph.addVertex(null);
a.setProperty("name","marko");
b.setProperty("name","peter");
Edge e = graph.addEdge(null, a, b, "knows");
e.setProperty("since", 2006);
graph.shutdown();
```
